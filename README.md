# Dorian

ðŸš§ Disclaimer! Dorian is a BIG work-in-progress; use with caution.

Dorian is an intuitive high-level abstraction for LLVM, written in Rust with only one dependency (LLVM!).

### What it does

Dorian takes the very complex library, LLVM, and boils it down
to concepts that are familiar with everyday programmers.

Streamline the development of your programming language or
any other project, and severely reduce the amount of unnecessary
boilerplate with Dorian!

### How to contribute
Currently, the project is riddled with little adequately-descriptive 
TODOs everywhere. 

Feel free to fix an issue that any TODO addresses, and open
 a pull request.
