# Dorian

🚧 **Disclaimer:** Dorian is a BIG work-in-progress; use with caution!

Dorian is an intuitive high-level abstraction for LLVM, written in Rust with only one dependency (LLVM!).

### ⛵What it does

Dorian takes the very complex library, LLVM, and boils it down
to concepts that are familiar with everyday programmers.

Streamline the development of your programming language or
any other project, and severely reduce the amount of unnecessary
boilerplate with Dorian!

### ℹ️ How to use

Grab the latest version on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dorian) to get started!

There's also some [examples](./examples) in this repository that outline how to use the library.

### 🚧 State of development

Take a look at the [complete breakdown](./llvm_comparison.md) of all the LLVM
functions and their Dorian equivalents to see where the project
is at and how suited it is for your project.

### 💾 In terms of LLVM

Dorian is very analogous to LLVM in terms of basic structures; however,
when it comes to higher-level concepts, Dorian quickly diverges
from LLVM for the sake of ease-of-use.

### 📝 How to contribute
Currently, the project is riddled with little adequately-descriptive 
TODOs everywhere. 

Feel free to fix an issue that any TODO addresses, and open
 a pull request.
